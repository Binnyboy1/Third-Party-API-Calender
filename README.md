# Third-Party-API-Calender

## Description

This is the 'Module 05' challenge assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.

Based on the starter code we were given, we were tasked with utilizing a third-party API to retrieve information on the date and time. We then make a dynamic calender out of this that'll allow us to save event dates.
